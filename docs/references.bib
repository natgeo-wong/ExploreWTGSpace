   abstract = {<p>The responses of tropical anvil cloud and low‐level cloud to a warming climate are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our estimates of climate sensitivity. However, most research on cloud feedbacks relies on either global climate models with parameterized convection, which do not explicitly represent small‐scale convective processes, or small‐domain models, which cannot directly simulate large‐scale circulations. We investigate how self‐aggregation, the spontaneous clumping of convection in idealized numerical models, depends on cloud‐radiative interactions with different cloud types, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and stages of aggregation in simulations that form part of RCEMIP (the Radiative‐Convective Equilibrium Model Intercomparison Project). Analysis shows that the presence of anvil cloud, which tends to enhance aggregation when collocated with anomalously moist environments, is reduced in nearly all models when SSTs are increased, leading to a corresponding reduction in the aggregating influence of cloud‐longwave interactions. We also find that cloud‐longwave radiation interactions are stronger in the majority of General Circulation Models (GCMs), typically resulting in faster aggregation compared to Cloud‐system Resolving Models (CRMs). GCMs that have stronger cloud‐longwave interactions tend to aggregate faster, whereas the influence of circulations is the main factor affecting the aggregation rate in CRMs.</p>},

It is found that neither method is able to capture the two different time scales present in the full 3D equations. Nevertheless, WPG is argued to have several advantages over WTG. First, WPG correctly predicts the magnitude of the steady-state buoyancy anomalies generated by an applied heating, but WTG underestimates these buoyancy anomalies. It is conjectured that this underestimation may short-circuit the natural feedbacks between convective mass fluxes and local temperature anomalies. Second, WPG correctly predicts the adiabatic lifting of air below an initial buoyancy perturbation; WTG is unable to capture this nonlocal effect. It is hypothesized that this may be relevant to moist convection, where adiabatic lifting can reduce convective inhibition. Third, WPG agrees with the full 3D equations on the counterintuitive fact that an isolated heating applied to a column of Boussinesq fluid leads to a steady ascent with zero column-integrated buoyancy. This falsifies the premise of the relaxed form of WTG, which assumes that vertical velocity is proportional to buoyancy.},

The premise of the relaxed form of WTG—that vertical velocity is equal to buoyancy times a positive time scale—is found to be violated by thick layers of negative buoyancy in steady-state ascent. The premise of WPG—that horizontal divergence and pressure anomalies are collocated—is validated by these simulations. When implemented in a cloud-resolving model, WPG replicates buoyancy transients exceptionally well, including the adiabatic lifting of air below buoyancy anomalies. WTG captures neither this effect nor the associated triggering of moist convection. For steady states, WTG produces vertical velocity profiles that are too top heavy. On the other hand, WPG generates velocity profiles that closely match fully resolved hot-spot simulations. Taken together, the evidence suggests that WPG is a relatively accurate method for parameterizing supradomain-scale (SDS) dynamics.},

An idealized radiative–convective equilibrium is simulated for model resolutions ranging between 2 and 50 km. The simulations are compared based upon the analysis of the mean state, the energy and water vapor transport, and the probability distribution functions for various quantities. It is shown that, at a coarse resolution, the model is unable to capture the mixing associated with shallow clouds. This results in a dry bias in the lower troposphere, and in an excessive amount of water clouds. Despite this deficiency, the coarse resolution simulations are able to reproduce reasonably well the statistical properties of deep convective towers. This is particularly apparent in the cloud ice and vertical velocity distributions that exhibit a very robust behavior.},

It hypothesizes 1) the approximate invariance of the difference between saturation moist static energy in the lower half of the troposphere and moist static energy in the subcloud layer, regardless of free troposphere humidity, and 2) that variations in the depth of convection are determined by moisture-deficit variations in the midtroposphere. Physical arguments for such a treatment are presented.

   abstract = {A limited-domain cloud system–resolving model (CSRM) is used to simulate the interaction between cumulus convection and two-dimensional linear gravity waves, a single horizontal wavenumber at a time. With a single horizontal wavenumber, soundings obtained from horizontal averages of the CSRM domain allow the large-scale wave equation to be evolved, and thereby its interaction with cumulus convection is modeled. It is shown that convectively coupled waves with phase speeds of 8–13 m s−1 can develop spontaneously in such simulations. The wave development is weaker at long wavelengths (&amp;gt;∼10 000 km). Waves at short wavelengths (∼2000 km) also appear weaker, but the evidence is less clear because of stronger influences from random perturbations. The simulated wave structures are found to change systematically with horizontal wavelength, and at horizontal wavelengths of 2000–3000 km they exhibit many of the basic features of the observed 2-day waves. The simulated convectively coupled waves develop without feedback from radiative processes, surface fluxes, or wave radiation into the stratosphere, but vanish when moisture advection by the large-scale waves is disabled. A similar degree of vertical tilt is found in the simulated convective heating at all wavelengths considered, consistent with observational results. Implications of these results to conceptual models of convectively coupled waves are discussed. In addition to being a useful tool for studying wave–convection interaction, the present approach also represents a useful framework for testing the ability of coarse-resolution CSRMs and single-column models in simulating convectively coupled waves.},

   abstract = {Recent observational analysis reveals the central role of three multicloud types, congestus, stratiform, and deep convective cumulus clouds, in the dynamics of large-scale convectively coupled Kelvin waves, westward-propagating two-day waves, and the Madden–Julian oscillation. A systematic model convective parameterization highlighting the dynamic role of the three cloud types is developed here through two baroclinic modes of vertical structure: a deep convective heating mode and a second mode with low-level heating and cooling corresponding respectively to congestus and stratiform clouds. A systematic moisture equation is developed where the lower troposphere moisture increases through detrainment of shallow cumulus clouds, evaporation of stratiform rain, and moisture convergence and decreases through deep convective precipitation. A nonlinear switch is developed that favors either deep or congestus convection depending on the relative dryness of the troposphere; in particular, a dry troposphere with large convective available potential energy (CAPE) has no deep convection and only congestus clouds. The properties of the multicloud model parameterization are tested by linearized analysis in a two-dimensional setup with no rotation with constant sea surface temperature. In particular, the present study reveals new mechanisms for the large-scale instability of moist gravity waves with features resembling observed convectively coupled Kelvin waves in realistic parameter regimes without any effect of wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE). A detailed dynamical analysis for the linear waves is given herein and idealized nonlinear numerical simulations are reported in a companion paper. A maximum congestus heating leads during the dry phase of the wave. It is followed by an increase of the boundary layer θe, that is, CAPE, and lower troposphere moistening that precondition the upper troposphere for the next deep convective episode. In turn, deep convection consumes CAPE and removes moisture, thus yielding the dry episode.},

   abstract = {New diagnostic applications of the gross moist stability (GMS) are proposed with demonstrations using satellite-based data. The plane of the divergence of column moist static energy (MSE) against the divergence of column dry static energy (DSE), referred to as the GMS plane here, is utilized. In this plane, one can determine whether the convection is in the amplifying phase or in the decaying phase; if a data point lies below (above) a critical line in the GMS plane, the convection is in the amplifying (decaying) phase. The GMS plane behaves as a phase plane in which each convective life cycle can be viewed as an orbiting fluctuation around the critical line, and this property is robust even on the MJO time scale. This phase-plane behavior indicates that values of the GMS can qualitatively predict the subsequent convective evolution. This study demonstrates that GMS analyses possess two different aspects: time-dependent and quasi-time-independent aspects. Transitions of time-dependent GMS can be visualized in the GMS plane as an orbiting fluctuation around the quasi-time-independent GMS line. The time-dependent GMS must be interpreted differently from the quasi-time-independent one, and the latter is the GMS relevant to moisture-mode theories. The authors listed different calculations of the quasi-time-independent GMS: (i) as a regression slope from a scatterplot and (ii) as a climatological quantity, which is the ratio of climatological MSE divergence to climatological DSE divergence. It is revealed that the latter, climatological GMS, is less appropriate as a diagnostic tool. Geographic variations in the quasi-time-independent GMS are plotted.},
